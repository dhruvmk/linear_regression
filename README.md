# linear_regression
This repository contains everything needed to create a linear regression algorithm from scratch.
The capstoneproject.csv file contains all the code. The libraries required
are Matplotlib, Pandas and NumPy. I obtained my data set (weight-height.csv) from Kaggle.com.
The same algorithm can be used to find a line of best fit for other problems as well.
