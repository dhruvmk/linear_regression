# linear_regression
This repository contains everything needed to create a linear regression algorithm from scratch. The research task is to be able to explain the variability in height by the variability in weight with a linear model.

I have implemented a basic approach that does not use machine learning. There is no "learning" involved; the parameters are assigned once using a concrete formula and it is not updated iteratively. I have also included a function that gives the "r" value of the data. This can be used to guage the accuracy of the model, and whether it fits the data. Note that it should NOT be used to determine if a linear model is appropriate; that should be done using residual analysis.
The libraries required are Matplotlib, Pandas and NumPy. I obtained my data set (weight-height.csv) from Kaggle.com.
The same algorithm can be used to find a line of best fit for other problems as well.
